          I&apos;m Denis Gichana, I&apos;m a front-end developer from Nairobi.
          I&apos;ve been a software developer for over 3 years. During my Computer
          Science bachelors degree, I decided to pursue my passion for programming.
          Every project I take on is personal. Whether itâ€™s solving a complex problem, building
          something from scratch, or refining the small details that make a product truly
          shine, I bring my creativity and dedication to the table.
          My core stack is React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind
          CSS. I am also familiar with Nest.js and Prisma. I am always looking
          to learn new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m open to Job opportunities where I can contribute, learn and
          grow. If you have a good opportunity that matches my skills and
          experience then don&apos;t hesitate to contact me.
        </p>
